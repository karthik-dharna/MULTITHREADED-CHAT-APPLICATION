##Description: A Java Multithreaded Chat Application enables real-time communication between multiple clients and a central server using Java Sockets and multithreading. This approach ensures efficient message handling and responsiveness, making it ideal for scalable chat systems.
Key Features & Architecture:
Client-Server Model: A dedicated server manages incoming connections, broadcasting messages to all connected clients.
Multithreading for Concurrency: Each client connection runs on a separate thread, allowing simultaneous communication.
Socket Programming: Uses ServerSocket for the server and Socket for clients to establish network communication.
Message Broadcasting: The server distributes messages from one client to all others in real time.
User Management: Supports multiple clients joining, leaving, and displaying active users.
Error Handling & Security: Manages disconnections and prevents unauthorized access.
A group chat platform where multiple users connect to a shared server and exchange messages instantly.
This Java-based chat system provides a solid foundation for real-world applications like customer support, team collaboration, and online gaming chats.
I am used visual studio code IDE for this project.
